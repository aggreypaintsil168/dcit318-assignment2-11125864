Second C# Assignment

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This program is part of DCIT 318 Assignment 2 and demonstrates Inheritance and Method Overriding in C#.

A **base class** called Animal is created with a method MakeSound().

**Two child classes**, Dog and Cat, inherit from Animal and override the MakeSound() method.

In the Main() method, we create objects of each class and call their sound methods.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

**Class:** A blueprint for creating objects (e.g. Animal, Dog, Cat)

**Object:** A real "thing" created from a class

**Inheritance:** One class (child) inherits properties and methods from another (parent)

**Method Overriding:** The child class replaces the parentâ€™s method with its own version
